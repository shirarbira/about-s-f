	<p class="name"> SHIRA ROSE FELDMAN </p>
	<p class="about-me"><b>About me:</b> I believe in the potential and promise of technology. For the past two and a half years I've been working in technology and development from a creative, editorial, and community-based role. I care deeply about our future and I care deeply for the cybernetic dream. I am passionate about contributing to bettering the current state of our technology-dominated culture, working to support an ethical future where privacy, civil liberties, and accountability are prioritized. I am seeking to facilitate and participate in these conversations and actions, particularly through strategizing, writing, creating, designing, programming and collaborating with others.</p>
